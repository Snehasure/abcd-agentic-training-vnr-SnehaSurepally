Trigger Type: Schedule Trigger

Trigger Interval: Daily

Days Between Triggers: 1

Trigger Time: 7:00 AM

Timezone: America/New_York (UTC-04:00)

Functionality:

This node ensures that the meeting reminder automation runs once a day at 7:00 AM.

Each execution generates a timestamp and readable date-time details (such as year, month, day, and time) which are passed to the next node in the workflow.

It serves as the starting point for fetching and processing upcoming meetings from Gmail.

### üìß Node 2 ‚Äî Gmail (Get Many Messages)

Purpose:

This node connects to Gmail and fetches all incoming meeting-related emails from your inbox. It acts as the data collection step of the automation.

Configuration Details:

Credential: Gmail Account 2

Resource: Message

Operation: Get Many

Return All: Disabled (Limited to 10 messages per run)

Simplify: Enabled

Filters Applied:

Label Names or IDs: INBOX

Search Query:

subject:(meeting) OR has:invite OR "Google Meet"


Read Status: Unread and Read emails (to include all meeting-related emails)

Functionality:

This node fetches the latest meeting invitations or reminders from the inbox.

It searches for emails that contain specific meeting-related keywords (like meeting, invite, or Google Meet).

The output includes essential metadata such as message IDs, snippets, MIME types, and labels.

The data is then passed to the next nodes for date extraction, storage in Google Sheets, and sending reminders.

### üß† Node 3 ‚Äî Code in JavaScript (Extract Meeting Details)

Purpose:

This node parses the Gmail messages to extract meeting details, such as the subject, date, time, meeting links, and filters out irrelevant or outdated emails.

It ensures that only upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours are considered for reminders.

Configuration Details:

Mode: Run Once for All Items

Language: JavaScript

Core Functionality:

Extracts meeting-related emails by scanning both the subject and body for keywords like meeting, invite, schedule, zoom, Google Meet, or teams.

Parses date and time from email content using multiple regex patterns that support various formats (e.g., 17/10/2025, October 17, 2025, 2025-10-17, etc.).

Converts extracted date and time into a standard JavaScript Date object for comparison.

Filters meetings that are scheduled within the next 24 hours from the current time.

Extracts meeting links for Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams using URL patterns.

Generates clean and structured output for each upcoming meeting.

If no valid meeting is found for the day, it returns:

{ "message": "No upcoming meetings found today." }

Sample Code Snippet:

const results = [];

function parseDateTime(dateStr, timeStr) {

  if (!dateStr) return null;
  
  let full = dateStr;
  
  if (timeStr && timeStr !== "Not Found") full += " " + timeStr;
  
  let parsed = new Date(full);
  
  if (isNaN(parsed)) {
  
  parsed = new Date(Date.parse(full.replace(/(\d+)(st|nd|rd|th)/, "$1")));
    
  }
  
  return isNaN(parsed) ? null : parsed;
  
}

// Extract meetings from Gmail messages

for (const item of items) {

  const json = item.json;
  
  // ... (extract subject, body, links, and parse date/time)
  
}

Example Output (When meetings found):

{

  "title": "Project Review Call",
  
  "date": "October 31, 2025",
  
  "time": "11:15 AM",
  
  "meetingDate": "2025-10-31T11:15:00.000Z",
  
  "meetingLink": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
  
  "body": "Discussion on upcoming sprint planning...",
  
  "messageId": "199f093549123532"
  
}

Example Output (When no meetings):

{

  "message": "No upcoming meetings found today."
  
}

## üìä Node 4 ‚Äî Google Sheets (Append Meeting Logs)

Purpose:

This node records all processed meeting information into a Google Sheet called MeetingLogs.

It helps you maintain a historical record of all upcoming meetings or logs a ‚Äúno meetings found‚Äù message when applicable.

Configuration:

Credential: Connected with Google Sheets account

Resource: Sheet Within Document

Operation: Append Row

Document: MeetingLogs

Sheet: Sheet1

Mapping Column Mode: Map Automatically

Functionality:

Takes structured JSON output from the previous JavaScript Code node.

Automatically maps fields like:

title

date

time

meetingLink

message (if no meetings found)

Appends each new entry as a new row in the selected Google Sheet.

Ensures duplicate entries are avoided in subsequent executions (by using message IDs or unique timestamps).

## üß© Node 5 ‚Äî Code in JavaScript (Filter & Prepare Meeting Reminders)

Purpose:

This node reads the meeting data fetched from Google Sheets and filters upcoming meetings within the next 24 hours (1440 minutes).

It then prepares structured reminder data that will be used to send WhatsApp or email notifications.

Configuration:

Language: JavaScript

Execution: Run Once for All Items

Output: A list of upcoming meetings ready for reminder delivery

Code Explanation:

const now = new Date();

const reminders = [];

for (const item of items) {

  const row = item.json;

  // Identify the date field (meetingDate / startTime / date)
  
  const meetingTime = new Date(row.meetingDate || row.startTime || row.date);

  if (isNaN(meetingTime)) continue;

  // Calculate time difference in minutes
  
  const diffMinutes = (meetingTime - now) / (1000 * 60);

  // Select meetings happening within next 24 hours (1440 min)
  
  if (diffMinutes <= 1440 && diffMinutes > 0) {
  
  reminders.push({
  
  json: {
  
  title: row.title || row.subject || "Upcoming Meeting",
  
  meetingTime: meetingTime.toLocaleString(),
  
  meetingLink: row.meetingLink || row.link || "",
  
  email: row.email || "snehasurapally@gmail.com",
  
  phone: row.phone || "+91xxxxxxxxxx",
  
  }
  
  });
  
  }
  
}

return reminders;


Logic:

Reads meeting rows from the Google Sheet (via previous node).

Converts the date or start time into a valid Date object.

Calculates time difference between now and the meeting time.

Keeps only those meetings that start within the next 24 hours.

Creates an array (reminders) with key meeting details:

title ‚Äî meeting name or subject

meetingTime ‚Äî formatted date and time

meetingLink ‚Äî URL to join the meeting

email ‚Äî recipient email for reminders

phone ‚Äî WhatsApp number for notification

Example Output:

[

  {
  
  "title": "Team Standup",
  
  "meetingTime": "10/31/2025, 10:00:00 AM",
  
  "meetingLink": "https://meet.google.com/xyz-1234",
  
  "email": "snehasurapally@gmail.com",
  
  "phone": "+91xxxxxxxxxx"
  
}

]

Outcome:

This node acts as a bridge between data and reminders ‚Äî transforming stored meeting data into ready-to-send reminder payloads.

The output feeds directly into your WhatsApp and Gmail reminder nodes, ensuring timely notifications for all scheduled meetings.

## üì± Node 6 ‚Äî Send WhatsApp Reminder via Twilio
